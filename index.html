            <figcaption>In the village of Giverny, France, Monet’s garden is a sanctuary that inspired the paintings of Claude Monet. Monet's garden helped him determine the subjects of his paintings, as he drew inspiration from the pond and surrounding flowers in his impressionist works. Common nature-related themes from Monet’s garden became a recurring motif throughout all of his works.</p></figcaption>
            <figcaption>The garden is divided into the Clos Normand flower garden and the Japanese water garden. The Clos Normand consists of flowers arranged in a formal manner, while the Japanese water garden consists of lilies and a water bridge that inspired a lot of Monet’s water-related works.</p></figcaption>

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>
